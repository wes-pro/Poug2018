# POUG 2018 - Advatech presentation
## Lost in Metrics, rescued by Pandas

### Presentation consists of two parts:
  * [PART1 - About company and capacity planning report](part1.html)
  * [PART2 - Internals and Pandas examples](part2.html)

## PLEASE READ BELOW:

This is not usual presentation and it was kind of experiment to prepare it.

It is delivered as HTML files and is only optimized for Google Chrome browser. It seems to work decently on Firefox but there are problems in full-screen (*please use Ctrl + / Ctrl - to adopt size to screen*).

Other files included in the package:
  1. [SSC_Report_2018-08-19_sizing_anonymized_en.html](reports/SSC_Report_2018-08-19_sizing_anonymized_en.html) - example of capacity planning report
  1. [part2.ipynb](part2.ipynb) - Python Jupyter source file

Second file requires following packages to be fully functional:
  * [Python3](http://python.org)
  * [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/)
  * [RISE](https://github.com/damianavila/RISE)
  * [Reveal.JS](https://revealjs.com/)
  * [cx_Oracle](https://oracle.github.io/python-cx_Oracle/)
  * [%%sql Magic for Oracle](https://github.com/catherinedevlin/ipython-sql)
  * [Plotly](https://plot.ly/)

Enjoy,
